                The Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, has serious celeb status.
                Completed in March 1889, it's one of the most recognizable
                monuments in the world. And the site, which is also known as the
                Iron Lady, receives nearly seven millions tourists a year. But
                despite its fame, the tower has some monumental secrets. Get the

                The monumental amphitheatre is the symbol of Rome par
                excellence. The Flavian theatre is the largest single building
                of the ancient world and a timeless masterpiece of Roman
                engineering that is unrivalled worldwide. It is therefore said
                in an ancient prophecy: "As long as the Colosseum stands, Rome
                also exists - if the Colosseum falls, Rome will fall too - when
                Rome falls, the world will fall." The Colosseum once had space
                for up to 73,000 people, who joined the gladiator battles and
                animal hunts as well as the execution and martyrdom of
                Christians. The latter is also the reason for the large bronze
                cross in the arena and the annual visit of the Pope.

              One of Italy's signature sights, the Torre Pendente truly lives up
              to its name, leaning a startling 3.9 degrees off the vertical. The
              58m-high tower, officially the Duomo's campanile (bell tower),
              took almost 200 years to build, but was already listing when it
              was unveiled in 1372. Over time, the tilt, caused by a layer of
              weak subsoil, steadily worsened until it was finally halted by a
              major stabilisation project in the 1990s.

          <p class="card-text"> The last remaining of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the great pyramids of Giza, are perhaps the most famous and discussed structures in history. These massive monuments were unsurpassed in height for thousands of years after their construction and continue to amaze and enthrall us with their overwhelming mass and seemingly impossible perfection. Their exacting orientation and mind-boggling construction has elicited many theories about their origins, including unsupported suggestions that they had extra-terrestrial impetus. However, by examining the several hundred years prior to their emergence on the Giza plateau, it becomes clear that these incredible structures were the result of many experiments, some more successful than others, and represent an apogee in line with the development of the royal mortuary complex.</p>

The 15th-century Incan city is located around 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, high in the Andes mountains. To get there, tourists need to follow the famous Inca Trail for 4 days. Passing through several types of Andean landscapes (including lush cloud forest and alpine tundra), the path is simply breathtaking, so instead of a hassle, the trek is actually a bonus.

                The famous Iguazu Falls is a series of waterfalls on the border of Argentina and Brazil. It consists of 275 individual waterfalls, spread over 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles) of river. The falls are up to 82 meters (269 feet) high, and are one of the largest waterfall systems in the world.

                The Iguazu falls were formed when the Paraná River carved out a gorge in the sandstone plateau, creating the Iguazu (meaning “Great Water”) Falls. They were first discovered by European explorers in 1541.
